# Temperature.py - A Comprehensive Temperature Conversion Program

## Overview

`Temperature.py` is a Python-based temperature conversion program. It allows users to input a temperature in one of three units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and converts the entered temperature to the other two units.

## Detailed Description

The script begins by defining a helper function `isfloat(x)`. This function attempts to convert its argument to a float. If the conversion is successful, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The main part of the script starts by welcoming the user and explaining the program's functionality. It then enters a loop where it prompts the user to choose the input temperature unit and enter the temperature value. The script checks if the user's input is a digit, and if so, it accepts the input and proceeds to the conversion process.

The conversion process is not shown in the provided excerpt, but it presumably converts the entered temperature to the other two units and displays the results.

## Installation

Python 3 is required to run this script. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the directory containing `Temperature.py` and run the following command in your terminal:
